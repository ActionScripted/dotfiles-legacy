dotfiles Seed/Starter
===

Automatically symlink (and backup!) configuration files. Non-destructive bootstrap script backs up existing files and symlinks to ~/.dotfiles.backups, every time it runs. (Done 1,000s of times by 1,000s of others but, damn it, I haven't done it yet.)

Would suggest submodules versus clones for things like Pathogen bundles or other git-in-git stuff.


Folders
---
`dotfiles`: your dotfiles! Put files here exactly as you'd like them to appear in your home directory.
`dotfiles-manual`: files you need, that don't necessarily belong in your home directory and should be manually moved/linked.


Personalizing
---
Clone/fork this repo and make it your own! Since these are your personal files, you may want to move things into a private repo and if you need more than GitHub offers BitBucket has unlimited private repos.


Quickstart
---
You can put the dotfiles folder anywhere, but it's important to run the bootstrap script from within the desired dotfiles folder. Here we're going to put the dotfiles folder at ~/.dotfiles:

* Clone the repo:

    `git clone git@github.com:ActionScripted/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`


* Change into the dotfiles folder:

    `cd ~/.dotfiles`

* Run the boostrap script:

    `./boostrap.sh`


Uninstalling / Reverting
---
First, breathe. Everything is backed up to ~/.dotfiles.backup

* Move anything you want to keep out of your dotfiles directory
* Delete your dotfiles directory
* Move things out of ~/.dotfiles.backup
* If you encoutered an error/problem, submit an issue at https://github.com/ActionScripted/dotfiles


Changelog
---

* [[2013/11/26]] -- copying a stripped-down seed version back to GitHub (public)
* [[2013/09/09]] -- moved to BitBucket from GitHub
